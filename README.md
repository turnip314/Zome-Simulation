# Zome-Simulation
This was part of a four-person group project during Canada/USA Mathcamp in 2018. The program simulates the type of patterns one might encounter when spinning zome figures about an axis.

To run the code, either upload or copy-paste the source code to codeskulptor.org and click run.
